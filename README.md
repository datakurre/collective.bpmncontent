[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/datakurre/collective.bpmncontent)

This repository has experimental support for developing with GitHub Codespaces. Its [Devenv](https://devenv.sh) based setup requires a few minutes to build and start up for the first time. First the space is ready, developed site could be started with:

```shell
make codespace-start
```

This will eventually start proxied site at port 8000, with backend proxied at path /api.
