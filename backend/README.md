## Features

TODO: List our awesome features

## Installation

Install collective.bpmncontent with `pip`:

```shell
pip install collective.bpmncontent
```

And to create the Plone site:

```shell
make create_site
```

## Add features using `plonecli` or `bobtemplates.plone`

This package provides markers as strings (`<!-- extra stuff goes here -->`) that are compatible with [`plonecli`](https://github.com/plone/plonecli) and [`bobtemplates.plone`](https://github.com/plone/bobtemplates.plone).
These markers act as hooks to add all kinds of subtemplates, including behaviors, control panels, upgrade steps, or other subtemplates from `plonecli`.

To run `plonecli` with configuration to target this package, run the following command.

```shell
make add <template_name>
```

For example, you can add a content type to your package with the following command.

```shell
make add content_type
```

You can add a behavior with the following command.

```shell
make add behavior
```

```{seealso}
You can check the list of available subtemplates in the [`bobtemplates.plone` `README.md` file](https://github.com/plone/bobtemplates.plone/?tab=readme-ov-file#provided-subtemplates).
See also the documentation of [Mockup and Patternslib](https://6.docs.plone.org/classic-ui/mockup.html) for how to build the UI toolkit for Classic UI.
